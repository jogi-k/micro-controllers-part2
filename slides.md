* Recap last micro-controller talk
* Shortcomings of the micro-controllers
* Target-Group
* Programming-Environment
* Micro:Bit 
* Calliope 
* Sinobit / Kniwwelino 
* Kickstarter - Thingy

---

### Short recap 

* complicated setup
* Arduino enters the world => all in one
* Raspberry Pi Pico => Python


---

### Micro-Controller 

* something to control 
   * LED
   * Motor
   * others
* somehow be controlled
   * Sensors
   * Switches
   * external events
* Actors / Sensors

### My target group 

* Newstarters in Computers
* Newstarters in Electronics
* Want to program, not only consuming
* Children, starting ~ 9y
* Want to _control_ something


---

### Micro:BIT 

* Launched in 2016 by BBC in UK
* Target: Every Schoolkid ~ 12y has one
* Platform
* [Web-Editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor)
* Simulator
