# micro-controllers-part2

Second Part of Lightning Talk about Micro-Controllers and more



* This repository mainly to create a slideset for a short talk, which I already held for some colleagues.
* It consists of two branches, a branch __main__ and a branch __gh_pages__
* The branch __gh_pages__ is mainly to create the Slides and publish them to a Web-Page for HTML-Slides
* The branch __main__ is more or less useless and should contain only some short explanation like a readme.

## Slides itself

* are in slides.md
* on commit will be published to : https://jogi-k.github.io/micro-controllers-part2/


## For local testing :

If you do not want to publish continuously to check the appearance of the HTML-Slides your can start inside your local repo a webserver

* _python -m http.server 8080_
* point with a browser to _localhost:8080_
